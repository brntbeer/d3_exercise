#D3.js Exercises [Disclaimer](https://github.com/brntbeer/d3_exercises#disclaimer)


##Getting Started
* Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/brntbeer/d3_exercise.git`
* Change directories:`cd d3_exercise`
* Start the server: `rackup`

Thats it! Now just open a browser to `localhost:9292` and start playing around
with some graphs!


##Wut?
I wanted to start messing around with a visualization framework. I chose
d3.js, and these are my exercises so far. Most of which are right off of
d3.js's website and links included on etc documentation etc.


##Oh ok.
Yeah, I decided to use Sinatra to render these, and viola! Here we are.
My js files are under ./public/javascript/ for your viewing pleasure.


##Disclaimer
As mentioned [above](https://github.com/brntbeer/d3_exercises#wut), these are a collection 
of exercises I've followed from other sites. They are for the most part not my own work, although
in some situations I've made alterations to them to get a better grasp of what is happeining.
