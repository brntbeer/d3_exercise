#D3.js Exercises


##Wut?
I wanted to start messing around with a visualization framework. I chose
d3.js, and these are my exercises so far. Most of which are right off of
d3.js' website and links included on his documentation etc., but give me a 
break, I'm getting there.


##Oh ok.
Yeah, I decided to use Sinatra to render these, and viola! Here we are.
My js files are under ./public/javascript/ for your viewing pleasure.
